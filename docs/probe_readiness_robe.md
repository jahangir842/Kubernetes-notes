### **What is `readinessProbe` in Kubernetes?**  
A **`readinessProbe`** is a Kubernetes mechanism that determines if a container is ready to **accept traffic**. If a container fails the readiness check, Kubernetes removes it from the list of available endpoints for a service, ensuring that no traffic is sent to an unready container.

---

### **Why Use `readinessProbe`?**  
- Prevents sending traffic to an unready or initializing container.  
- Ensures the service only routes requests to healthy instances.  
- Useful for applications with long startup times or dependencies (e.g., database connections).  

---

### **Types of `readinessProbe`**  
Kubernetes provides three types of `readinessProbe` checks:

1. **HTTP Request Probe (`httpGet`)**  
   - Sends an HTTP request to the container.
   - If the response is successful (HTTP 2xx or 3xx), the container is ready.
   - Otherwise, Kubernetes marks it as **not ready** and removes it from the service.

   **Example:**
   ```yaml
   readinessProbe:
     httpGet:
       path: /ready
       port: 8080
     initialDelaySeconds: 5
     periodSeconds: 10
   ```
   - **`path: /ready`** â†’ Endpoint checked for readiness.  
   - **`port: 8080`** â†’ Port used for the request.  
   - **`initialDelaySeconds: 5`** â†’ Wait 5 seconds before the first check.  
   - **`periodSeconds: 10`** â†’ Check every 10 seconds.  

---

2. **Command Probe (`exec`)**  
   - Runs a command inside the container.  
   - If the command exits with `0`, the container is ready.  
   - Any non-zero exit code marks it as **not ready**.

   **Example:**
   ```yaml
   readinessProbe:
     exec:
       command:
       - cat
       - /tmp/ready
     initialDelaySeconds: 5
     periodSeconds: 10
   ```
   - The container is marked as **ready** only if `/tmp/ready` exists.  

---

3. **TCP Socket Probe (`tcpSocket`)**  
   - Checks if a TCP connection to a specific port is open.  
   - If the connection is successful, the container is **ready**.  
   - Otherwise, Kubernetes removes it from the service.

   **Example:**
   ```yaml
   readinessProbe:
     tcpSocket:
       port: 3306
     initialDelaySeconds: 5
     periodSeconds: 10
   ```
   - Useful for **databases or applications with open ports**.  

---

### **Common Parameters in `readinessProbe`**  
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| `initialDelaySeconds` | Time to wait before the first probe (seconds). |
| `periodSeconds` | How often to perform the probe (seconds). |
| `timeoutSeconds` | Time to wait for a response before marking failure. |
| `failureThreshold` | Number of failed attempts before marking as "not ready". |
| `successThreshold` | Number of successful checks needed to mark as "ready". |

---

### **Example: Full Kubernetes Pod with `readinessProbe`**  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-app-image
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /ready
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10
```
- If `/ready` endpoint does not respond, Kubernetes **removes** the container from the service.

---

### **Difference Between `readinessProbe` and `livenessProbe`**  

| Feature | `readinessProbe` | `livenessProbe` |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Purpose | Checks if a container is ready to receive traffic. | Checks if a container is still running. |
| Action on Failure | Kubernetes **removes** the container from the service but keeps it running. | Kubernetes **restarts** the container. |
| Use Case | Ensures traffic is only sent to healthy containers. | Prevents stuck or frozen applications. |

---

### **Conclusion**
- Use `readinessProbe` for **traffic control**â€”only send traffic to ready containers.  
- Choose **HTTP, Command, or TCP probes** based on your application needs.  
- Configure **delays and thresholds** to prevent unnecessary removals from the service.
