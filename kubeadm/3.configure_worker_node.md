### **Step 6: Join Worker Nodes to the Cluster**
On `worker-node1` and `worker-node2`, run the join command provided by `kubeadm init`.  
If you lost it, get the command from the master node:
```bash
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```
Run the output command on each worker node.

### **Step 7: Verify the Cluster**
1. On the master node, check nodes:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

2. Check pods:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -A
   ```
