If you want to run Kubernetes in production without relying on cloud providers, there are several **on-premise** and **self-managed** options that allow you to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters. Below are some alternatives you can consider:

### 1. **Kubeadm**
   - **Description**: A tool that helps you bootstrap a secure Kubernetes cluster on bare-metal or virtual machines. It's part of Kubernetes and is widely used for setting up production clusters.
   - **How it works**: Kubeadm initializes the control plane and joins worker nodes to the cluster.
   - **Pros**: 
     - Direct control over configuration and infrastructure.
     - Highly customizable.
     - Lightweight and uses native Kubernetes components.
   - **Cons**: 
     - Requires you to manage infrastructure, networking, and storage manually.
     - No built-in monitoring or dashboards (these need to be set up separately).
   - **Use Case**: Best for those who want to self-manage Kubernetes on their own hardware or VMs.

   **Getting Started**:
   - Install Kubernetes using `kubeadm` on multiple nodes:
     ```bash
     kubeadm init
     kubeadm join <control-plane-node>
     ```

### 2. **Rancher**
   - **Description**: Rancher is a complete container management platform built on Kubernetes. It provides an intuitive UI for managing Kubernetes clusters and also simplifies multi-cluster deployments.
   - **How it works**: You can deploy Rancher on any bare-metal or virtualized infrastructure, and it helps you set up and manage Kubernetes clusters.
   - **Pros**: 
     - Offers a user-friendly UI and multi-cluster management.
     - Integrates monitoring, logging, and storage solutions out of the box.
     - Support for HA deployments.
   - **Cons**: 
     - Requires some learning to manage large, production-level clusters.
     - Adds an extra layer of complexity on top of Kubernetes.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for teams that want a Kubernetes management platform and need features like multi-cluster management and a visual UI.

   **Getting Started**:
   - Install Rancher on a node:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 80:80 -p 443:443 rancher/rancher
     ```

### 3. **K3s (Lightweight Kubernetes)**
   - **Description**: K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for IoT, edge, and resource-constrained environments. It’s a production-ready Kubernetes distribution from Rancher but uses less memory and has fewer dependencies.
   - **How it works**: K3s simplifies Kubernetes installation by packaging it into a single binary and includes built-in components like a local storage provider and simplified networking.
   - **Pros**: 
     - Lightweight and easy to set up.
     - Ideal for resource-limited environments or small-scale deployments.
     - Simplified version of Kubernetes, making it easier to manage.
   - **Cons**: 
     - Limited functionality for large-scale, complex deployments.
     - Doesn’t have all the advanced features of full Kubernetes distributions.
   - **Use Case**: Great for small clusters, edge computing, or environments with fewer resources.

   **Getting Started**:
   - Install K3s on your system:
     ```bash
     curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
     ```

### 4. **MicroK8s**
   - **Description**: A lightweight, single-package Kubernetes distribution maintained by Canonical (the makers of Ubuntu). It's ideal for both local development and small production environments.
   - **How it works**: MicroK8s installs Kubernetes with a minimal footprint and includes optional add-ons (e.g., Istio, Knative, and Prometheus).
   - **Pros**: 
     - Fast and simple to install.
     - Minimal system requirements, ideal for development or small production clusters.
     - Managed by Canonical, with official Ubuntu support.
   - **Cons**: 
     - Not suitable for very large production environments.
     - Lacks some features present in larger distributions.
   - **Use Case**: Best for small-scale Kubernetes clusters or single-node setups that need to be easy to manage.

   **Getting Started**:
   - Install MicroK8s:
     ```bash
     sudo snap install microk8s --classic
     ```

### 5. **OpenShift (OKD)**
   - **Description**: OKD (OpenShift Kubernetes Distribution) is the open-source version of Red Hat’s OpenShift. It's a Kubernetes distribution with enterprise features such as integrated CI/CD pipelines, developer tools, and security enhancements.
   - **How it works**: OKD adds extra management tools and features on top of Kubernetes, providing a more enterprise-friendly solution.
   - **Pros**: 
     - Provides a rich set of built-in features (e.g., monitoring, CI/CD).
     - Enhanced security features like multi-tenancy and advanced RBAC.
     - Managed through a user-friendly web interface.
   - **Cons**: 
     - Complex to set up and maintain.
     - Resource-heavy and overkill for smaller clusters.
   - **Use Case**: Suited for enterprise environments needing a robust Kubernetes distribution with built-in tools for development and security.

   **Getting Started**:
   - Deploy OKD via the official [OKD documentation](https://www.okd.io/).

### 6. **Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (VMware)**
   - **Description**: VMware’s Kubernetes distribution, integrated with vSphere, designed for on-premise and hybrid cloud Kubernetes environments.
   - **How it works**: Tanzu manages Kubernetes clusters and provides lifecycle management, monitoring, and scaling, all tightly integrated with VMware's vSphere.
   - **Pros**: 
     - Seamless integration with VMware environments.
     - Built for enterprise use with advanced management tools.
     - Lifecycle management and enterprise-grade support.
   - **Cons**: 
     - Primarily focused on VMware environments.

   - **Use Case**: Perfect for enterprises already using VMware that want to integrate Kubernetes into their infrastructure.

   **Getting Started**:
   - More information can be found on [VMware Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid).

### 7. **Bare Metal Kubernetes**
   - **Description**: Deploying Kubernetes directly on physical servers (bare metal) gives you full control over your infrastructure. You'll have to manage everything manually, from the underlying hardware to networking and storage.
   - **How it works**: You can use tools like **Kubeadm**, **Kuberspray**, or **MetalLB** to manage load balancing, networking, and other components.
   - **Pros**: 
     - Full control over hardware and configurations.
     - No abstraction layers like VMs, resulting in better performance.
   - **Cons**: 
     - Requires in-depth knowledge of infrastructure, networking, and storage.
     - Complex to manage, monitor, and maintain.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for performance-critical applications where you want full control over the environment and hardware.

### 8. **Kuberspray (Kubernetes the Hard Way)**
   - **Description**: **Kuberspray** is an open-source project that uses Ansible to deploy production-ready Kubernetes clusters on any environment (bare metal, VMs, or cloud).
   - **How it works**: You use Ansible playbooks to automate the installation and configuration of Kubernetes, networking, and security.
   - **Pros**: 
     - Automates Kubernetes deployments across various platforms.
     - Can be used for both small and large-scale production environments.
   - **Cons**: 
     - More complex than tools like K3s or MicroK8s.
     - Requires knowledge of Ansible for configuration.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for production environments where you need flexible, automated Kubernetes deployments.

   **Getting Started**:
   - Follow Kuberspray installation guide from the official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray).

### Conclusion:
If you prefer **self-managed** Kubernetes environments without cloud dependencies, the best choices include **Kubeadm**, **Rancher**, **K3s**, or **MicroK8s**. For large, enterprise-level setups, consider **OpenShift (OKD)** or **Tanzu Kubernetes Grid**. For complete control and performance, **Bare Metal Kubernetes** or **Kuberspray** are great options.

Each solution offers a different level of complexity and feature set depending on your production needs.
