In Kubernetes, a configuration file typically consists of three key parts: **metadata**, **spec**, and **status**. Here’s a breakdown of these sections:

1. **metadata**: Provides information about the object, such as its name, namespace, labels, and annotations. It helps identify and manage resources.
   
2. **spec**: Defines the desired state of the object. It includes the configuration settings like the number of replicas, container images, ports, and other desired behaviors.

3. **status**: Reflects the current state of the object as observed by the Kubernetes control plane. It’s managed by the system and updates automatically based on what’s happening in the cluster.

Here’s an example of a full Nginx **Deployment** configuration file that includes the three parts: **metadata**, **spec**, and **status**.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment  # Name of the deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx  # Labels to categorize the deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Number of pod replicas to run
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx  # Labels for the pods
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest  # Nginx container image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80  # Exposed port inside the container
status:
  replicas: 3  # The current number of replicas in the cluster
  readyReplicas: 3  # Number of replicas currently running and ready
  availableReplicas: 3  # Number of replicas available for service
```

### Explanation:
1. **metadata**: Includes the name `nginx-deployment` and a label `app: nginx`. This metadata helps identify and organize the deployment.
   
2. **spec**:
   - Defines the desired state:
     - `replicas: 3`: Specifies 3 replicas (pods).
     - The `template` defines the container configuration (the Nginx image, ports, etc.).

3. **status**:
   - Reports the current state of the deployment, which is auto-generated by Kubernetes and not manually specified. Here, it shows that all 3 replicas are running, ready, and available.

This configuration file ensures that Kubernetes maintains 3 Nginx replicas and exposes them on port 80. The **status** section reflects the runtime conditions but doesn't need to be manually included in the deployment file; Kubernetes will update it dynamically.
