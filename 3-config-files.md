A Kubernetes configuration file typically consists of two sections: **Deployment** and **Service**. It uses **YAML** format, which is:

- Human-friendly data serialization standard that is compatible with all programming languages.
- **YAML** requires strict indentation for proper structure and readability.
- The configuration file is stored as part of the code repository.
- YAML files can be verified using **online YAML validators** to ensure correctness.
- Most modern **code editors** support YAML syntax validation through plugins, helping to catch indentation and syntax errors. 

This ensures the YAML files used in Kubernetes deployments are easy to read and reliable across environments.
In Kubernetes, a configuration file typically consists of three key parts: **metadata**, **spec**, and **status**. Here’s a breakdown of these sections:

1. **metadata**: Provides information about the object, such as its name, namespace, labels, and annotations. It helps identify and manage resources.
   
2. **spec**: Defines the desired state of the object. It includes the configuration settings like the number of replicas, container images, ports, and other desired behaviours.

3. **status**:
   - **status** reflects the current state of the object as seen by the Kubernetes control plane.
   - It is automatically managed and updated by Kubernetes based on real-time events in the cluster.
   - The data in the **status** section comes from **etcd**, the central data store (often called the "brain" of the cluster) located in the master node.
   - **etcd** stores both the desired and current states of all components in the cluster.
   - It plays a crucial role in Kubernetes' self-healing by constantly comparing the desired state with the actual state and taking corrective actions when needed.

## Example:

Here are two separate YAML configuration files for deploying Nginx in Kubernetes: 

One for the **Deployment** and another for the **Service**.

### 1. Deployment Configuration (`nginx-deployment.yaml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### 2. Service Configuration (`nginx-service.yaml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

### Instructions for Deployment

**Deploy the Nginx Application**:
   - Run the following commands to apply both configuration files:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
   ```

**Verify the Deployment**:
   - Check the status of the Deployment:

   ```bash
   kubectl get deployments
   ```

   - Check the status of the Service:

   ```bash
   kubectl get services
   ```

### Instructions for Deletion

To delete the Deployment and Service, use the following commands:

```bash
kubectl delete -f nginx-deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f nginx-service.yaml
```

### Summary

- **Deployment File**: Defines how to run Nginx Pods.
- **Service File**: Exposes the Nginx Pods for network access.
- Use `kubectl apply -f <filename>` to deploy and `kubectl delete -f <filename>` to remove the resources.  
 

### Explanation:
1. **metadata**: Includes the name `nginx-deployment` and the label `app: nginx`. This metadata helps identify and organize the deployment.
   
2. **spec**:
   - Defines the desired state:
     - `replicas: 3`: Specifies 3 replicas (pods).
     - The `template` defines the container configuration (the Nginx image, ports, etc.).

3. **status**:
   - Reports the current state of the deployment, which is auto-generated by Kubernetes and not manually specified. Here, it shows that all 3 replicas are running, ready, and available.

This configuration file ensures that Kubernetes maintains 3 Nginx replicas and exposes them on port 80. The **status** section reflects the runtime conditions but doesn't need to be manually included in the deployment file; Kubernetes will update it dynamically.

### View Status:
To view the status and details of a specific Kubernetes Deployment (in this case, named **nginx**) in YAML format, you can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get deployment nginx -o yaml
```
- **`-o yaml`**: This option formats the output in YAML, which provides a structured view of the resource's configuration and status.

- It provides a comprehensive view of the **nginx** Deployment
- Allowing to monitor its status and configuration details in a structured format. 
- Useful for troubleshooting and understanding the current state of your Kubernetes resources.

We can save it in a file too.
```bash
kubectl get deployment nginx -o yaml >> nginx-depl-result.yaml
```

### Template

In the Kubernetes configuration file, the **template** section is a nested configuration within the **Deployment** specification. It defines the **Pod** specification and serves as a blueprint for the Pods. Here’s a breakdown:

- The **template** section acts as a **mini configuration** within the deployment, concentrating on Pod-level details.
- It includes the complete specification for the Pod, covering key attributes such as:
  - **name**: The name of the Pod.
  - **image name**: The container image to be used.
  - **ports**: The container ports that need to be exposed.
- Within the template, the **metadata** part contains **labels**, which are key-value pairs used to categorize the Pod.
- The **spec** part outlines the container details and includes the **selector**.

In summary, the **template** serves as the fundamental specification for the Pod, ensuring that the Deployment accurately creates and manages Pods in a consistent manner.

### Selector

The **selector** in Kubernetes is a crucial component that enables communication between `Services and Pods`. It is a key-value pair that matches the labels assigned to Pods, determining which Pods the Service should route traffic to.

- **Purpose**: Defines the Pods that a Service targets, ensuring correct traffic routing.
  
- **Key-Value Pair**: Consists of a label name (key) and its corresponding value. For example, a selector of `app: nginx` matches all Pods labeled as such.

- **Types of Selectors**:
  - **Equality-based Selectors**: Use equality (e.g., `app = nginx`) or inequality (e.g., `app != nginx`).
  - **Set-based Selectors**: Allow matching with a set of values (e.g., `app in (nginx, apache)`).

- **Dynamic Management**: Services automatically adjust which Pods they route traffic to as Pods are added or removed, based on matching labels.

- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Selectors enhance application scalability and flexibility, allowing for easy traffic management without changing the application architecture.

In essence, the **selector** is vital for directing traffic to the correct Pods, enabling dynamic service discovery, and improving the resilience and scalability of applications within the Kubernetes environment.

### Config File Organization

- **Separate Config Files**: 
  - Maintain distinct files for **Deployment** and **Service** to promote modularity and clarity.

- **Directory Structure**: 
  - Organize files in a dedicated folder, e.g.:
    ```
    k8s/
    ├── deployment.yaml
    └── service.yaml
    ```

- **Easier Updates**: 
  - Simplify updates by modifying only the relevant file, reducing error risks.

- **Reusability**: 
  - Facilitate reuse across environments (development, staging, production) without duplication.
